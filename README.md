## Obtaining the Datasets

* Movies database information: The data originates from [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset).


## Installation

Install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Python (Minimum 3)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda)
* [EC2 (AWS) for Model deployment](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/)
* [Seaborn for visualization](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Jira for resolving customer complaints](https://atlassian.net/)
* [FastApi for back-end processing](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## Front End Processing

### HTML Page Development
Front-end development involved working with HTML for structuring web content and communicating with the users to get inputs


## Back End Processing:

### FastApi for web development 
FastApi was used to create routes for each HTML page and was also used validate request and response data through the HTML pages

### Jira
Jira which is an issue tracking software was used to manage and track tasks and issues from the users by assigning it to the responsible persons for prompt closeout

## Web Deployment
The webapp is hosted on anvil.works **[retinopathyBOT](https://retinopathyBOT.anvil.app)**. This involve writing some Java Script with Python. Hopefully, the app is still up and running by the time you are reading this readme. This is because of the monthly payment to host the webapp on anvil.works

## Limitiation
* The speech recognition API currently works of firefox and chrome browser
* Cloud deployment cost money, so the app might not be on for long time
